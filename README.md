# TMU-MRP-2025
# Optimizing Supervised Machine Learning for Enhanced Transaction Fraud Detection Accuracy
## Literature Review and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
## Overview

This repository contains the second phase of my Major Research Project (MRP) for the MSc in Data Science and Analytics program at Toronto Metropolitan University. The focus of this phase is on conducting a comprehensive **Literature Review** and performing an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection dataset.

## Objectives

- Understand recent advances in fraud detection using supervised machine learning
- Identify gaps in existing research to inform model development
- Analyze patterns in fraudulent transactions through statistical and visual EDA
- Prepare cleaned datasets and feature insights for modeling in later phases

## Dataset

**Source:** [IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ieee-fraud-detection/data)

This dataset includes anonymized transaction and identity data, representing real-world e-commerce transactions.

## Next Steps

The next stage of this project will focus on **Methodology** and **Experiements**:
- Feature engineering and transformation
- Model development using supervised learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, ANN/DNN)
- Evaluation with metrics suited for imbalanced classification
